**Disclaimer**: _This is not a “guide” or a polished blog about loneliness. It’s me, speaking from my own experience—raw and real._

If you don’t know what it feels like to be lonely, let me give you an example: Imagine a room full of people—friends, family, and familiar faces everywhere. And yet, even in the middle of that crowd, you feel invisible. It’s a **strange**, **heavy feeling**. That’s what loneliness is like, and that’s what I want to talk about here.

# Different Faces of Loneliness
## How I Feel About Loneliness

Well, this is how I feel about loneliness: people ignore me, cut me off from their lives, they don’t treat me like they treat others. Sometimes my family members around my age get treated well, and I don’t. No matter how much I do for others, I don’t get anything in return. Even though I don’t expect much, it still feels like I’m invisible.

This blog post might be something I want the people around me to read, to maybe give me some attention. Maybe I *am* trying to get some attention through this blog. Or maybe not, because honestly, I know no one gives a sh!t about me anyway.

I feel empty. I feel like my life is meaningless. Furthermore, I feel like no matter how good I do my work, no matter how hard I try, it’s never enough for anyone. Maybe no one even notices, because everyone is too busy caring about their other friends—not me. Not even for a second.

No one texts me asking, _‘How are you today?’_. No one asks how my day went. Not even a small wave from a distance

So what am I trying to do here? Seeking attention, for sure. Why? Because I want to be mentioned. I want to be noticed. I had so much friends in my life. 

I really thought that they are wonderful friends who care about me. And little by little I realized they are talking, texting to me only I start to text to them. You see that if they text me when I text to them. If I don't text them they don't text me. Like they are just re-texting back to me because they need to keep the friendly thing between us and not too much. If I don't text for months, of if I went offline for a month or two and check my inbox, no one even noticed that I was not there online, they don't waste their time to check on me, just text me "Hi"? No they don't even bother much as I bother about them. It's just me. Like I tag some of my friends as my best friends, because they support me or something. But they all just the same. I have seen those "Best Friends" in the group chat chatting to others more than they chat with me. Even I just send a text says "Hello" in the group chat no one notice me. 
In the end I realize that I was just invisible to everyone. 

## What Teenagers have

Teenage is a very big thing for teenagers. And here I am speaking _as a teenager_. 
I go to school every day, I sit with people that I thought they were my friends. Sometimes I ask for help but no one want to help me. And I know I have helped them more than I ask for help from them. But they don't remember anything. In the school, people just gang up. Like everyone, have a little small friend group. They be always together, sit together, eat together. I had a little group like that. I thought people in my group do care about each other. But it is just not like that. They are just there with in the group because they expect some gold from it. Not for just friendships. And if I look at them one by one, they all have friends outside the group. And in the end again I was someone invisible, no one want to really keep some company with me. It's just like that, every time.

See, this is what _Teenagers_ want. **Love**, **Care**, **Be Someone**.
They want to be **loved**.
They want to be **cared**.
Furthermore, they want to **be someone**, they want to be **noticed**.

Emotions are the only things teenagers have. They don't have money, they don't have their own properties, they don't have anything until they face the real life after the teenage years. Emotions are the things why teenagers look for girlfriends or boyfriends. They want to express their emotions. 

When they don't get those things in their life that is when they start to feel _lonely_.
Teenagers like to talk about their stuff with someone in their age more than talking to their parents. When they are talking to people in there age they **_think these people get me_**, and if you have being the one who listen to your friends stuff you might get almost about everything he/she tells you. I wanted to talk about my stuff with someone, be open to someone and just talk about everything with honest. But I don't have anyone to be with me and to listen to my stuff.

If you have watched the Netflix series **_13 Reasons Why_**, you might have seen how much she wanted someone to listen to her stories. She tried to talk to the School Counselor. She tried to share that she felt like she wanted to end her life during her Social class (I don’t remember the exact name of the class). Not only that, but she even tried to reach out to her mother, giving one last chance to be heard. But no one showed any real interest. That day ended in her suicide.  

Everyone bullied her. High school was a nightmare for her. Since starting high school, she had been bullied, harassed, and even raped by a boy. She wanted someone who could understand her, someone who would really hear her. But there was no one.  

I suggest watching the **_1st season of 13 Reasons Why_** to see how loneliness, being ignored, and feeling invisible can be so damaging.
