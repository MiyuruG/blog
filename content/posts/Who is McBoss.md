# McBoss (About me)
I'm a student living in Sri Lanka. I am still going to school. 

### Hobbies
Furthermore, I have a lot of hobbies like 
- Coding
- Graphic Designing
- Sports
- Art
- Gaming
- Traveling

I have a lot of hobbies, and I think everyone has their own as well. I'd mention that I love to do coding as a hobby. And in that stream I like to do Vibe Coding, Game Dev and Website Building stuff. If I dig deeper into Game Dev as a hobby of mine, I am a complete beginner at right now. Currently, I only participated in a one Game Jam, with a teammate. Game development wasn't originally my hobby. My teammate convinced me to join a Game Jam, even though we knew we probably wouldn't place. It was a great experience, though, and now I love game development—it's become a new hobby of mine. So big shoutout to my teammate. I can't mention his name since I didn't ask for permission. But if you guys dig a bit deeper into EXE 2025 Game Jam you will find my teammate. Again, a big shoutout to him. And I will make a New Blog post about the whole Game Jam after the ceremony. 

And I love to make apps like web apps, Windows apps etc. I usually use Python for everything. And I normally make an app for everything.

I play few games often. I don't play games like 24/7. Furthermore, I like Minecraft, Among US, etc. And I got a cheap Xbox 360 USB Edition controller too. I even have a Minecraft server to

### Dream
Like many students, I have a big dream. Well, it is leave this country and move to London or NYC. I like London more than NYC, but as a second opinion NYC is good 🥲. 

### Currently
Um o currently I am a student as I mentioned earlier. And I am not doing a lot in school, like school subjects aren't my strongest suit. I believe that Education is a really useful tool for navigating life today. Because you need education to navigate today's world. So I'll keep doing it, even if I'm bad at it, and hopefully it will turn out great for me in the future.
