Confession: I love collecting books more than finishing them.  
I’ve only fully read a few, some I’m halfway through, and others are still on my wishlist.  

This post is my **ongoing book list** — a mix of favorites, current reads, and books I plan to buy.  
I’ll keep updating it as I continue my reading journey.  

# Types of Books I Enjoy
Mainly, I’m into **Motivation, Romance, and Self-Help**.  
That’s my taste — and here are some books that match it:

Stay tuned — future McBoss might have a way longer list 😉

## I like to read Motivation and Self-Help books more, thank anything
You see, that I have some issues in my life. I always kind an unmotivated and I do feel like I need some help from someone and at the same time I don't like to ask for help. I always keep my stuff with me. Furthermore, I don't like to talk about my stuff, my life, what I am dealing with currently, how much fcked I am, etc. So it was like basically I am unmotivated. Because I was unmotivated, my productivity is in a range of a risk. Like I have my school stuff, my daily life stuff, etc. And I am not achieving them. My mind always reminds me do it soon as I can. But I can't, I don't have this energy in my body, in my mind. And in the same time I think I kind an act like a super sigma boy in my social life, in school, social media(*mostly in discord*), etc. In these days my laptop screen time is skyrocketing, Netflix, YouTube, Discord, etc. This does not mean I was just watching online content, most of my activities are based on **Vibe Coding**... I like Vibe Coding 🥲. So I looked for a hobby, a **New Hobby**. First I start to watch some movies (_Yes Watching Content I Know!_). And I downloaded a movie named "*The Fault In Our Stars*". And this is the start of my book reading journey! 

## The Movie made me read my first Book
